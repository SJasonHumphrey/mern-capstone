# Coding Buddy
Coding Buddy is a hub for prospective web development students to learn, study, and practice working with one of the most popular programming languages  - Javascript. Normally this functionality would span multiple websites but we combined them into one place. Below are some features that the site is currently offering

## Typing Test
Normal run of the mill typing tests only have regular text for you to practice with. Coding, however, is a whole different ball game. Our preview text includes real code snippets so you can practice typing all the special characters that you would use on your day to day as a developer. Coding is already hard enough without having the keyboard to slow you down. Practicing with special characters included will make sure your fingers never interfere with your thoughts.

## Flash Cards
Make your own flashcards to study with! Customize your own to tailor your studying experience. 

## Quizzes
Use our quiz feature to test your skills. We have some options to choose from and we are always adding more. Quizzes are a great way to check on the information that you have retained and a way to see what you still need to work on. 

## Resources 
Many of the most popular javascript resources one one page. This cuts down on having to find your own sites, we did that work for you.

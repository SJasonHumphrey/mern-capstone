# Coding Buddy

## Typing Test
Normal run of the mill typing tests only have regular text for you to practice with. Coding, however, is a whole different ball game. Our preview text includes real code snippets so you can practice typing all the special characters that you would use on your day to day as a developer. Coding is already hard enough without having the keyboard to slow you down. Practicing with special characters included will make sure your fingers never interfere with your thoughts.

## Code Pen
A Code Pen is used for sharing, testing, and showcasing code snippets. Use this convenient feature as your code playground. There's no need to change between files and browser tabs, which makes the coding process quicker.

## Flash Cards
Make your own flash cards to study with! Customize your own to tailor your studying experience. You can add, edit, delete, and review your cards. Once a card is and you click "review" you will see the first question appear. Click the text once you've guessed to reveal the answer. </br>

## Quizzes
Use our quiz feature to test your skills. Quizzes are a great way to check on the information that you have retained and a way to see what you still need to work on. Go through 10 code related questions, at the end you will see your score.
